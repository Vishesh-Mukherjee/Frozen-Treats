# Frozen-Treats
 A console based ice-cream shop program that is structurized using decorator patter. <br />

 # Decorator Pattern <br />
 -> A Design should be open for extenstion but close for modification. <br />
 -> In decorator pattern, we wrap the concrete class with wrapper class/ extension. <br />
 -> Inheritance is powerful but not always flexible. <br />
 -> Using decorator pattern, we can 'inherit' the behaviour during run-time rather the during compile time.
